# About

This is a simple Spring Boot "Hello-World" application which I have used on this [article](https://dzone.com/articles/running-springboot-app-on-openshift) for demo purpose. Application is deployed on OpenShift(minishift) for demo purpose.
> Minishift is a tool that helps you run OpenShift locally by running a single-node OpenShift cluster inside a VM. You can try out OpenShift or develop with it, day-to-day, on your localhost.
